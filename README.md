I was bored

You can change the number of rounds by changing the NUM_ROUNDS variable at the top

idk how many combinations it has but I do know that it has 94^256 possible combinations for the key

This is 13,204,760,283,529,711,086,017,975,496,827,969,102,122,578,748,228,854,932,215,768,953,608,425,957,914,283,378,793,017,392,640,590,182,002,206,404,278,763,711,059,841,035,864,423,601,625,110,254,131,892,757,565,869,495,470,338,450,089,708,080,064,566,367,418,705,500,800,588,966,751,865,304,590,703,827,220,828,902,312,168,631,896,511,588,754,032,589,566,627,857,130,891,842,176,335,593,555,479,284,390,295,575,803,372,353,530,458,476,431,465,822,620,855,640,835,321,633,973,740,736,105,593,048,630,603,713,155,210,875,181,236,521,246,988,904,838,997,921,007,024,818,852,561,511,543,790,205,251,774,474,107,664,518,880,852,848,565,042,488,233,058,496,752,224,510,521,901,056 combinations

That's over 13 with 504 zeroes!

If my not-so-credible sources and not-so-good math are correct, it could take 41,872,020,178,620,342,104,318,795,969,139,932,464,873,727,638,980,387,278,715,654,977,195,668,308,962,085,802,869,791,326,232,211,383,822,318,633,557,723,589,104,011,402,411,287,422,707,731,653,132,587,384,468,130,059,203,254,851,882,635,971,792,764,990,546,377,158,804,505,856,011,749,443,780,770,634,261,887,691,248,632,140,716,995,144,450,889,743,679,058,400,338,951,808,017,299,573,679,221,475,108,750,557,468,836,737,476,085,985,640,112,324,393,885,213,201,806,297,481,420,396,073,037,318,082,837,750,999,527,128,301,739,349,464,069,332,949,638,257,886,303,966,427,452,789,015,062,802,041,395,465,841,148,271,438,523,746,083,975,419,308,277,830 years to find the correct key
