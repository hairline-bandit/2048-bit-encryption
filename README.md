I was bored

You can change the number of rounds by changing the NUM_ROUNDS variable at the top

It has 94^256 possible combinations for the key and 2^2048 possible combinations for the ciphertext

This is 13,204,760,283,529,711,086,017,975,496,827,969,102,122,578,748,228,854,932,215,768,953,608,425,957,914,283,378,793,017,392,640,590,182,002,206,404,278,763,711,059,841,035,864,423,601,625,110,254,131,892,757,565,869,495,470,338,450,089,708,080,064,566,367,418,705,500,800,588,966,751,865,304,590,703,827,220,828,902,312,168,631,896,511,588,754,032,589,566,627,857,130,891,842,176,335,593,555,479,284,390,295,575,803,372,353,530,458,476,431,465,822,620,855,640,835,321,633,973,740,736,105,593,048,630,603,713,155,210,875,181,236,521,246,988,904,838,997,921,007,024,818,852,561,511,543,790,205,251,774,474,107,664,518,880,852,848,565,042,488,233,058,496,752,224,510,521,901,056 combinations (key)

It would take a 4 GHz processor 104,666,774,599,950,151,284,226,184,978,027,656,167,743,965,981,522,312,398,666,526,265,127,028,835,718,796,597,915,483,454,665,426,299,954,077,395,995,273,549,935,328,439,001,455,307,745,008,355,515,954,007,338,851,422,561,338,380,546,195,942,173,163,977,637,171,058,977,401,448,572,172,674,308,051,896,170,172,022,131,964,425,305,259,898,177,176,518,441,882,190,320,956,263,287,377,881,701,643,027,824,156,434,712,843,639,271,230,789,723,096,247,787,378,256,462,600,142,467,824,477,691,764,811,593,244,397,235,343,018,240,619,223,581,078,827,195,608,124,659,359,692,870,652,437,728,203,909,731,883,910,174,893,142,682,727,081,206,741,346,171,991,889 years (worst case) to guess the key (but my math is probably wrong so take this with a grain of salt)
